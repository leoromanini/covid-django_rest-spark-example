# covid-django_rest-spark-example
This project is a example of Django Rest Framework usage handling data with Apache Spark

There is a endpoint that access Our World Data and get a input information about COVID-19 statistics, this data are handled with Spark and persisted in a sqlite database.
All this information became avaliable in a rest API that containg filters.

###### This is not the best approuch to use Spark (In this case Pandas are more then sufficient) but the ideia is make a code example :)
